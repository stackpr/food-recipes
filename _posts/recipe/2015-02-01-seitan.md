## Instructions

To make the broth: Combine all broth ingredients in the slow cooker and turn it on high. The broth can heat up while you make the seitan.

To make the seitan: In a large bowl, combine all the dry seitan ingredients. Mix the wet ingredients in a smaller bowl and all into the dry ingredients. Mix until combined and knead for 10 minutes. Let the dough rest for about 5 minutes. The dough will be sticky.

Stretch the dough out to the thickness you want and cut into desired sizes. We usually cut into small chunks, but you can shape into "steaks" or small "roasts". And you can always cut it up after it is cooked, so you don't have to worry if they pieces are too big. If you do make large roast pieces, plan to turn them once during cooking so they don't stick to the bottom due to their weight.

Drop the pieces individually into the slow cooker. It is done when the pieces float to the top or it has cooked for 3 hours. It should be spongy, but not sticky when done. It may look like they are all stuck together when done, but they will easily come apart when pulled a bit.

Store in the fridge submerged in the broth or freeze in the broth.
